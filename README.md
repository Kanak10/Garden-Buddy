# What is Garden Buddy?
Garden Buddy is a web application. Here we are try to make gardening smart to people who are enthusiast toward gardening. We saw problem that people regularly faced in gardening, is that plant is not grow properly, spots on leaf, yellowish color of leaf etc. These all are symptoms of poor health. So, we decide to built this system.<br/>
Plant leaf disease has been one of the major threats to food security since long ago because it reduces the yield and compromises its quality. Health monitoring and disease detection on plant is very critical for sustainable agriculture. It is very difficult to monitor the plant diseases manually. It requires tremendous amount of work, expertize in the plant diseases, and also require the excessive processing time.
